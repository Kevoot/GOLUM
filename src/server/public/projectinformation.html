		<h2>
			Based on Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a simulation of cellular automata developed
			by John Conway in 1970, GoLUM is a physical display utilizing the same concept
			as split-flap alarm clocks and Solari boards (The old ticker boards you saw in train 
			stations before they were electronic). 
			<br>
			GoL is a "Zero-Player" game. Once the initial board has been set it's hands off from
			there to watch the board evolve step-by-step.
			<br>
			Each open slot you see is a single swappable module, which contains 1 stepper motor, 
			1 calibration switch, and 16 cards on a rotating barrel which represents 16 states in
			total. Each set of 11 modules connect to their on Arduino Mega, which transmits
			its working status via serial communications to Raspberry Pi you're reading this on.
